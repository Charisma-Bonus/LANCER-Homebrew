  "description": "A system of integrated launchers fire a sort of ‘sticky’ chaff that both clings to targets and, through simple chemical reactions with the heat produced by mechs, releases a glow that makes shooting them all the easier. It's actually named for the bright orange color of the sticky chaff, something many pilots have called “festive”.",
