  "description": "The Volk is perhaps most well known for its use in the frontier, where G&S market it as the ultimate in cheap and effective colony defense. And given the Volk’s tendency to be used to fight everything from pirate lances to ornery Xenofauna, many have claimed that is nothing more than a bootleg Blackbeard for bumpkins who don’t know better. Fans of the core, however, are quite likely to punch the speaker of such words right in the fucking mouth. After all, the Volk may suffer from ammunition problems; but it's rough and tumble enough to tear the head off mechs twice its size.",
