This attack automatically hits but deals half damage, but cannot be used if the target is not Adjacent to you when the Ram started (? don’t use magnet harness with this, i will find better words later)"

After all, Pre-Fall stories tell of a knight with a magical lance that could unhorse any it touched. We at G&S think our reactive lance is up to the task.",
